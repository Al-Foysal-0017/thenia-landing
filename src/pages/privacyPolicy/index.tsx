              One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience

              if you personalize THEIA pages, or register with THEIA site or

              on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording
              your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
              addresses, and so on. When you return to the same THEIA website,
              the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you
